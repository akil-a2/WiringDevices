# Packet Tracer – Networking Cabling Legend (CCNA)

This Packet Tracer project demonstrates **network cabling types** and their applications in real-world networking scenarios, using **CCNA terminology**. It serves as a visual reference and learning tool for networking students or anyone preparing for CCNA certification.

---

## 🖧 Overview

The project includes a simple topology illustrating:

- **Straight-Through Cables** – Connect unlike devices (PC → Switch, Router → Switch).  
- **Crossover Cables** – Connect like devices (Switch ↔ Switch, Router ↔ Router, PC ↔ PC).  
- **Console (Rollover) Cables** – For device management (PC → Router/Switch console port).  
- **Fiber Optic Cables** – High-speed uplinks between switches or routers.  

A visual **legend of wiring types** is included to help learners quickly identify cable purposes.
